General:
* consider adding Users with permissions (admin / DM / player) with different visibility

Initiative Tracker:
* refactor new/edit dialogs to load server-side HTML (like for `/characters`); use
  fontawesome icons like we do everywhere else instead of making the `tr` click-sensitive
* do something with `Combatant#effect` (currently an `int`); maybe bootstrap Badges?
