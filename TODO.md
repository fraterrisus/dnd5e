General:
* consider adding Users with permissions (admin / DM / player) with different visibility
* write some damn unit tests
* figure out how to unit test javascript?!?!

Database:
* rename `name` fields to something else, so we don't populate 'New' dialogs with the `name` of
  the class

Initiative Tracker:
* do something with `Combatant#effect` (currently an `int`); maybe bootstrap Badges?
